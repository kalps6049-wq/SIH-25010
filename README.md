## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description

Small and marginal farmers, who form the majority of India’s farming community, face persistent challenges that directly affect their productivity and livelihoods. Rising input costs for fertilisers, seeds, pesticides, and irrigation put them under constant financial strain, while limited access to affordable credit forces many to depend on moneylenders at high interest rates. Although agricultural advisory services exist, most provide generic information without showing farmers the direct financial benefit of following the advice, leading to low adoption and mistrust. As a result, farmers often overuse or misuse inputs, fall into debt cycles, and fail to realise the true value of their produce in the market. Low literacy levels and limited access to smartphones further worsen the problem, making it difficult for smallholders to benefit from digital platforms. Without a system that links advisory guidance directly to financial savings and income growth, farmers remain vulnerable to poverty, debt, and unsustainable practices.


Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

This problem needs to be solved because small and marginal farmers form the backbone of agriculture yet remain the most vulnerable to financial stress, crop losses, and debt. Without clear, trusted, and financially rewarding guidance, they continue to overspend on inputs, underutilize resources, and depend heavily on moneylenders for survival. By not addressing their economic pain points, existing advisory systems fail to gain farmer trust or adoption, limiting their real-world impact. Solving this issue is crucial not only for improving farmer livelihoods and reducing poverty but also for ensuring national food security, promoting sustainable farming practices, and enabling financial inclusion. A system that directly links agricultural advice to visible savings and income growth will empower farmers to make better decisions, escape debt cycles, and build resilience against climate and market uncertainties.




Expected Outcomes

The Farm Wallet–enabled Smart Crop Advisory System is expected to deliver measurable benefits for small and marginal farmers by directly linking agricultural advice to financial savings and income growth. Farmers will be able to reduce input costs through precise recommendations on fertiliser, pesticide, and irrigation use, while also gaining better market access and price awareness, leading to improved profitability. By tracking these savings in a digital Farm Wallet, farmers build a financial record that can open doors to micro-credit, insurance, and government subsidies, reducing their dependence on informal moneylenders. The system is also expected to increase adoption of advisory services, as farmers can clearly see the monetary value of each recommendation. In the long run, this approach will not only improve crop productivity and household income but also encourage sustainable farming practices, strengthen community confidence, and support broader goals of financial inclusion and rural development.


Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

The primary beneficiaries of the Farm Wallet–enabled Smart Crop Advisory System are small and marginal farmers, who will gain from reduced input costs, increased income, and improved financial inclusion. Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), cooperatives, and self-help groups will also benefit by using the system to coordinate input purchases, improve market linkages, and strengthen collective bargaining power. Local agri-input suppliers and dealers become important stakeholders as they can partner in the wallet redemption model, increasing their sales while supporting farmers with affordable inputs. Extension workers, Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), and NGOs engaged in rural development will benefit by accessing real-time data and farmer feedback to improve advisory delivery. Financial institutions, including banks, microfinance agencies, and insurers, stand to gain by leveraging Farm Wallet transaction records to extend credit and insurance to farmers with lower risk. At a broader level, state and national governments benefit as the system supports policy goals of financial inclusion, food security, and sustainable agriculture, while the rural community as a whole gains through stronger local economies and reduced farmer distress.


Supporting Data

Supporting data highlights the urgency and potential impact of the Farm Wallet system. In India, small and marginal farmers account for nearly 86% of the total farming population, with an average landholding of less than two hectares. Studies show that these farmers spend a significant portion of their income—up to 40–50%—on inputs such as fertilisers, pesticides, and irrigation, yet many fail to achieve optimal yields due to inefficient practices. According to NABARD and other surveys, over 60% of smallholder farmers rely on informal moneylenders at high interest rates, leading to cycles of debt and financial vulnerability. Furthermore, adoption rates of existing digital advisory platforms remain low, particularly among low-literacy farmers, because advisories rarely demonstrate direct financial benefits. By linking crop advice to measurable savings and income growth, the Farm Wallet system addresses these challenges, providing a data-driven approach to improving farmer livelihoods, reducing debt dependency, and promoting sustainable agriculture practices.

## Proposed Solution
<ul><li>The proposed solution is a Farm Wallet–enabled Smart Crop Advisory System that provides small and marginal farmers with actionable agricultural advice directly linked to financial savings and income growth. Through this system, farmers receive personalized recommendations on crop selection, irrigation, fertiliser use, pest management, and market prices via SMS, IVR, or WhatsApp in their local language. Each advisory includes a monetary value—for example, cost saved or potential profit gained—credited to the farmer’s digital Farm Wallet. Farmers can track their wallet balance and redeem points for input discounts, mobile recharge, or microcredit, creating a tangible incentive to follow advisory recommendations. </li>
  
<li>The Farm Wallet–enabled Smart Crop Advisory System directly addresses the problems faced by small and marginal farmers by transforming traditional advisory services into financially meaningful actions. Unlike generic advisories that often go ignored, this system attaches a clear monetary value to each recommendation, allowing farmers to immediately see how much money they save or earn by following the advice. By recording these savings in a digital Farm Wallet, the system builds trust and motivates adoption, while also creating a financial history that can be used for access to microcredit, insurance, and government schemes. In doing so, it reduces farmers’ dependency on moneylenders, helps cut down unnecessary input costs, and improves income stability. </li>



## Technical Approach

<ul><li>The Farm Wallet system will be developed using a combination of modern software technologies and affordable hardware to ensure scalability and farmer accessibility. On the backend, Python and Django/Flask will be used for building the core advisory engine, supported by machine learning libraries (TensorFlow/PyTorch, Scikit-learn) for predictive crop recommendations and cost-benefit analysis. The frontend farmer interface will be lightweight and multilingual, developed using React Native or Flutter for mobile apps, and WhatsApp/SMS/IVR integration APIs to reach low-literacy users without smartphones. A MySQL or PostgreSQL database will handle farmer profiles, transaction histories, and wallet balances securely. The digital wallet component will be built using blockchain or secure fintech APIs to ensure transparent and tamper-proof credit tracking. On the hardware side, affordable Android smartphones for field agents, cloud servers (AWS/Azure/GCP) for real-time processing, and optional IoT-based soil and weather sensors can be integrated for hyper-local advisory. This technology stack ensures that Farm Wallet remains cost-effective, farmer-friendly, and scalable for rural deployment.

## Feasibility and Viability
<h3>Remove These Lines</h3>
<ul><li>The feasibility of the Farm Wallet–enabled Smart Crop Advisory System can be analyzed across technical, economic, and social dimensions. From a technical standpoint, the idea is highly feasible because it uses proven technologies such as mobile-based advisory platforms, digital wallets, and cloud computing, all of which can be integrated using open-source frameworks and affordable APIs. On the economic side, the solution is viable as the costs of development and deployment are relatively low compared to the potential benefits it provides; farmers save on inputs, increase productivity, and reduce reliance on moneylenders, while partnerships with agribusinesses, government programs, and financial institutions can generate sustainable revenue streams. From a social feasibility perspective, the solution addresses a critical need of small and marginal farmers by making advisories practical, understandable, and directly tied to financial benefits, which increases trust and adoption.</li>
  
<li>While the Farm Wallet solution has strong potential, it also faces several challenges and risks that need to be addressed for successful implementation. One key challenge is digital literacy, as many small and marginal farmers may struggle to understand mobile-based systems or digital wallets, especially those who are semi-literate or elderly. Network connectivity in remote rural areas can also limit the effectiveness of real-time advisories. Another risk lies in adoption hesitancy, since farmers are often cautious about new technologies and may not immediately trust a digital system unless they see tangible benefits</li>

<li>To overcome the challenges and risks associated with Farm Wallet, a set of targeted strategies can be implemented. To address digital literacy barriers, the system will provide voice-based advisories in local languages through IVR and WhatsApp voice notes, along with community training sessions and demonstrations to build trust and familiarity. Network issues can be mitigated by designing the app and advisory system to work in low-bandwidth environments and enabling offline data storage with periodic synchronization when connectivity is available. Strong data security measures such as encryption and compliance with digital privacy standards will be implemented to safeguard farmer information. Finally, to manage climate unpredictability and diverse farming practices, the advisory engine will integrate localized weather data, soil health reports, and machine learning models that continuously improve recommendations based on farmer feedback. Together, these strategies will build resilience, trust, and scalability for the Farm Wallet system.</li></ul>

## Impact and Benefits

<ul><li>The Farm Wallet solution has the potential to create a transformative impact on small and marginal farmers, who are often the most vulnerable segment of the agricultural community. By directly linking crop advisories to measurable financial benefits, farmers can clearly see the value of adopting improved practices, leading to higher trust, faster adoption, and better decision-making. The system is expected to significantly reduce input costs, optimize the use of fertilisers, pesticides, and water, and increase crop yields, thereby improving farm income and livelihood security. With access to a digital wallet that records savings and builds a financial history, farmers can also unlock opportunities for microcredit, crop insurance, and government subsidies, reducing dependency on moneylenders and breaking the cycle of debt. Beyond financial gains, the platform empowers farmers with knowledge, confidence, and inclusion in the digital economy, bridging the rural–urban digital divide. Over time, these impacts will not only improve the economic resilience of individual farmers but also contribute to community-level sustainability and food security.</li>
